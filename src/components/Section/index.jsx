            To improve people's lives, we don't think adding more stuff would do
            any good. Quite the opposite. We believe it's about removing

            Getting rid of inefficiencies, stealing time from things we rather
            would be doing. And eliminating hassles getting in the way of us
            spending time with our loved ones. That would do good.
